 abstract = {There is a deep and useful connection between statistical mechanics (the behavior of systems with many degrees of freedom in thermal equilibrium at a finite temperature) and multivariate or combinatorial optimization (finding the minimum of a given function depending on many parameters). A detailed analogy with annealing in solids provides a framework for optimization of the properties of very large and complex systems. This connection to statistical mechanics exposes new information and provides an unfamiliar perspective on traditional optimization problems and methods.},

abstract="This paper studies a statistical skin-color model and its adaptation. It is revealed that (1) human skin colors cluster in a small region in a color space; (2) the variance of a skin color cluster can be reduced by intensity normalization, and (3) under a certain lighting condition, a skin-color distribution can be characterized by a multivariate normal distribution in the normalized color space. We then propose an adaptive model to characterize human skin-color distributions for tracking human faces under different lighting conditions. The parameters of the model are adapted based on the maximum likelihood criterion. The model has been successfully applied to a real-time face tracker and other applications.",
